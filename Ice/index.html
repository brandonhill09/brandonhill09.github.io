	<h2 style="font-family: Arial; color: purple"> I am a student at Ayala High School, currently in the CSP class right now. I thought this was going to be hard, but i think it will soon enough. Challenges will arise, and I realize that I will be the only one that will be able to face them, i look forward to having help though. I got this weird picture online and I don't give a care. People are creating bios of themselves, yet again I do not care. All I want is some sleep and to be able to play some games every once in a while, if I can have this I will be adaquette with my ending life. </h2>
